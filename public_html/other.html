                I've reserved this part of the site for posting various things that
                make me happy. We've already covered computer programming and music in
                the first couple sections of the site, so now I would just like to briefly
                mention:
            </p>
            <h2 class="content-header">Motorcycles</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                What's not to be said about the joy of riding a motorcycle? There's nothing
                quite like the feeling of the wind rushing over your body. Or the roar of a parallel-twin engine.
                The new intimacy you share with the flora and fauna living on the side of the road.
                Getting to wave at other motorcyclists!
                And the bugs which seem to aim themselves to collide directly with the few small areas of skin
                you've left exposed...

            <p class='content-text'>
                This bike was actually my graduation present to myself. Although it cost having a bit of
                my brain fried, I managed to pay my way through university with cash and graduate 
                completely debt free. I managed to do this by taking a year off after high school to 
                work 50-60 hour weeks as a shift manager at Burger King. The overtime money eventually
                accumulated into enough dough to pay for my last two and a half years of class. I left
                Burger King shortly after hitting this mark with the intention of focusing solely on 
                school, but ended up getting two more jobs after deciding to move out of my parents house
                and into an apartment with my girlfriend. I worked at the music store K&S Music 15-20 hours
                a week part time, and simultaneously found a full-time position in the deli at Walmart. Our apartment was situated
                above an event hall in Kulpmont PA, so rent was cheap. At the same time though, Kulpmont was about
                a 45 minute drive from campus in Bloomsburg. 
                Needless to say, my work life balance wasn't great, but I also never fell into debt. If I ever had
                the choice to do it all over again, I don't think I would change anything. Jeez was I tired during
                those four years though.
                <br><br>
                With the bit of money I had leftover, I purchased a Triumph at the
                recommendation of my bass player, Paul. After learning to ride it with some help from my Dad 
                (who was actually just getting back into riding himself after about 25 years) I got to spend most
                of my summer traveling around by motorcycle. It's been a really great experience so far and very fun
                to learn something new. I would recommend it to anybody who thinks they may be interested. The PA MSF
                course is free to anybody with a motorcycle learners permit, and a permit only cost $10.00 or so. I guess
                I'll finish this section off with some photos I was able to take while riding through the farmland
                behind my home town.

            <h2 class="content-header">Vintage Stereo Equipment</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                Another one of my hobbies is collecting and restoring old stereo equipment. I guess
                I discovered my affinity for this type of work as a teenager, after tearing apart an 
                old, non-functioning BSR record player at my grandparents house. I eventually got the
                thing to work by having a belt bypass the mechanism for selecting playback speed, as all
                of the moving parts within that assembly had become glued together by the decaying lubricant
                that had been applied to them in the 70s. A couple years later I bought a pioneer turntable
                and Denon AM-FM Multiplex Solid State receiver from a Pawn Shop. The turntable worked after 
                minor fidgeting. The Denon receiver required some DeOxit on all of the pots and electrical 
                contacts, as well as a pretty massive cleaning on the exterior. The pioneer turntable has since
                been retired, but the Denon runs as my workstation's audio amplifier to this day.

                    <p>My current listening setup consists of 70s Pioneer Silverface Components.</p>

            <p class="content-text">
                From what I can remember, I acquired the setup I have now through Ebay and Craigslist.
                I run a Pl-510A turntable and CT-F750 Cassette Deck through an SA-6800 Integrated Amp.
                The tuner I have connected is actually the TX-7800, a level above the 6800 series. The whole
                setup is connected to a DT-400 Digital Timer as well. The DT-400 isn't particularly useful to me,
                but it does look cool. The speakers I use with this setup are actually custom builds within repurposed
                cabinets I bought from a man I met on Craigslist.

            <p class='content-text'>
                My last notable hobby would have to be my cats. There isn't much to be said about them that hasn't
                been said about other cats, so I'll just leave their pictures here. Behold, my boys:
